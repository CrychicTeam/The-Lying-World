; This is really only an INI because Fabrication's entire config framework is

; The value is ignored, but is recommended to be set to "true" in case it's
; given meaning later.

; Example: Prevent sandstone from being crafted.

;sandstone=true

; Example with a weirder ID: Prevent dark oak saplings from being transformed
; into oak saplings with a Botania mana pool with an Alchemy Catalyst.
